# Privacy Policy

## Who we are

PR Monitor is made by Zenc Labs Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based company focused on building developer tools. We strive to protect your privacy and collect as little data about you as needed to conduct our business.

## What this privacy policy covers

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use the PR Monitor website, application or browser extension.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services”.

## Information we collect

The authentication token you provide, either directly (e.g. via form input) or indirectly (e.g. by signing in to PR Monitor with GitHub) is stored in your local browser.

Our Services also locally cache information fetched using this authentication token, such as the list of pull requests and so on, to provide a snappy experience and reduce your network usage.

## Sharing information

We do not share your personal information with marketers or unaffiliated third parties. Your authentication token is securely communicated with GitHub for the sole purpose of fetching the data required to operate PR Monitor.
